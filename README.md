# Ubuntu-Server-Administration
## Overview
This project involved configuring and managing an Ubuntu virtual machine on Microsoft Azure to simulate real-world server administration tasks. Over the course of several assignments, I implemented services, hardened security, and automated processes used in enterprise environments.

## Key Implementations
- **User & SSH Management:** Created users, configured public-key authentication, disabled root login, and secured SSH with Fail2Ban.
- **Web Hosting:** Deployed Apache and PHP to host a custom index page and WordPress site.
- **Database Setup:** Installed and configured MySQL with PHP integration.
- **LDAP Integration:** Set up phpLDAPadmin and tested directory authentication for WordPress.
- **VPN Configuration:** Generated keys and established secure connections using OpenVPN.
- **Remote Access:** Enabled xRDP + XFCE for GUI remote access from macOS.
- **Firewall & Networking:** Used UFW and Vyatta routing to control traffic and simulate enterprise networking.
- **Automation:** Used Bash scripts and cron jobs for maintenance tasks and logging.
